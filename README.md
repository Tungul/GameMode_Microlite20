What is Microlite20? Microlite20 is a tabletop pen and paper RPG designed around the original AD&D.
This thing is *really* lightweight - the core rules fit on one side of a sheet of paper, everything else is resources.  

The other day, I had an inkling to DM a game, but I didn't have a good system and I was just gonna do something simple like roll to dodge, but luckily for you and I, my players weren't frigging ready for a week so in that week I discovered Microlite20.  
I made some web based calculator tools for microlite and then I realized: this would work spectacularly in Blockland! Chat, dice rollers, macros, or at least the scripting language to make them, and my target players all had Blockand, so why not?

That's what this sets out to achieve.  

Features:
* **Built in character creator, as well as import/export function for sharing** --- *Just join and follow some instructions. Your character is created live.*  
* **Built in character sheet manager** --- (no guis, sorry (unless someone feels like making them: this is open source)) *You join the server and your data is there.*  
* **Built in dice roller** --- *Why leave it to your DM to roll all the dice offline? Take some initiative and roll them yourself, where everyone can see!* [Credit to M for the script.](http://forum.blockland.us/index.php?topic=189605.0)  
* **Casual save, designed with a peaceful atmosphere in mind** --- *A custom build (or a modified default one) with a table with evented gameboard, with low lights for atmosphere.*  
* **Some as-of-yet undecided DM utilities**  
* **The DM does not have to be the host** --- *Much like the DM does not always host game sessions, the host will not have to be the DM.*
