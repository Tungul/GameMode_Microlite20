TODO:  
* preview.jpg and thumb.jpg
* save.bls -- perhaps a nice little area like an actual table and chairs, with a full size gameboard out back, with bots for mini's? perhaps a miniature table with bots for actual minis on the table, objective being a casual area like an actual game session
* modify dice.cs to work in chat, not commands
* create BL_ID tied characters
* load characters from text/json/something files for easy creation, along with exporting to allow creation of characters ingame
* Get M's (BL_ID 4332) permission to use/modify dice.cs, despite already having done so
